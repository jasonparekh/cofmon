A coffeescript shell for mongodb so that you can write coffeescript instead of javascript in the mongo shell.

To use, just 'npm install -g cofmon' and then use `cofmon` as you would the mongo command.

In additon to being able to write coffeescript instead of javascript, any 24 character hex string that's wrapped in double quotes is automatically made into an ObjectId.  IE, 
"51bb660191888d7acc355ed8" compiles to ObjectId("51bb660191888d7acc355ed8")
'51bb660191888d7acc355ed8' compiles to '51bb660191888d7acc355ed8'
